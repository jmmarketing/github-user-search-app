## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences.

## My process

- Review figma files strategize variables, UI states, typography, etc..
- Build out basic structure with SCSS and MVC in mind.
- Structure Index.html with elements needed.
- Create BEM naming conventions & start basic styling
- Move to states, interactions, etc..
- Start responisve break points, implement with mixins.
- Test and tweak
- Build out single JS file working on features from top down (light/dark --> search --> render).
- Comment and section JS file for MVC refactor down the line.
- Test and tweak.
- Move to refactor to MVC.
- Break it, obviously.
- Once working, review requirements, update/fix where needed.
- Test, test, find ways to break it and fix again.
- Deploy

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (Responsive Mixins)
- MVC
- [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/)
- Vanilla JS
- SVG Media
- Some â˜•â˜•

### What I learned

This was a great learning project. Starting, then taking 5-6weeks away from it, and coming back was a fun project in itself. From a feature stand point, there were a couple new challenges, including: - Implementing a light/dark toggle - Detecting a users preferred scheme setting - SVG Manipulation techniques

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
